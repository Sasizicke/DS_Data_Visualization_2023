# Worldwide particulate matter pollution and PM2.5 related deaths

## Project description

This work discusses the visualization of air pollution, specifically focusing on particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and death rates associated with PM2.5 (per 100,000), for which a total of three datasets were used.

To visualize the data, an interactive dashboard was created using the Python packages Streamlit and folium. The corresponding dashboard displays choropleth maps for each of the three data sets. In addition, a timeline feature was implemented to allow users to select specific years to observe. The dashboard also includes additional information such as maximum, minimum, and median values, as well as the countries with the high-est and lowest values.


## Running the WebApp

To start the Streamlit WebApp you first have to install all necessary packages which can be found in `requirements.txt`. Afterwards the script can be executed within the console using the command `streamlit run ../Data_Visualisation_Brech_Saskia.py`.
